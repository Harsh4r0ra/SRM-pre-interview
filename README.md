# YOLO and BERT-based AI Projects

This repository contains code and documentation for several AI projects using the YOLO object detection model and the BERT language model.

## 1. Fine-Tuning YOLO for Medical Anomaly Detection

This project focuses on fine-tuning a pretrained YOLO model to detect medical anomalies in X-ray images. The key steps include:

1. Preparing a labeled dataset of X-ray images with anomalies.
2. Fine-tuning the YOLO model using the dataset, adjusting hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs for optimal performance.
3. Evaluating the fine-tuned model on a test set and analyzing its performance metrics.

## 2. Real-Time Object Detection with YOLO and Webcam

This project demonstrates how to build a real-time object detection application using YOLO and a webcam. The main considerations are:

1. Setting up the YOLO model and webcam input pipeline.
2. Optimizing the pipeline for minimal latency while maintaining detection accuracy.
3. Implementing a user-friendly interface to display the real-time object detections.

## 3. Comparing YOLO with Other Object Detection Models

In this project, we compare the performance, speed, and ease of use of YOLO with another object detection model (e.g., Faster R-CNN or SSD) for a specific use case, such as traffic surveillance. The steps include:

1. Preparing a dataset for the specific use case.
2. Training and evaluating both models on the dataset.
3. Analyzing the results and drawing conclusions based on the comparison.

## 4. BERT-based Text Classification for Customer Queries

This project focuses on building a text classification system using BERT to categorize customer queries into two categories: Technical Support and General Inquiry. The main steps are:

1. Preprocessing the dataset of customer queries.
2. Fine-tuning a pretrained BERT model for binary classification using the Hugging Face transformers library.
3. Evaluating the model's performance using appropriate metrics for binary classification.
4. Proposing how the classifier can improve a customer service chatbot's efficiency.

### Dataset Preparation

- Collect a dataset of customer queries and label them as either Technical Support or General Inquiry.
- Preprocess the text data by lowercasing, removing punctuation, and tokenizing.
- Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

### Model Training

- Use the Hugging Face transformers library to load a pretrained BERT model (e.g., bert-base-uncased).
- Fine-tune the model for binary classification using the prepared dataset.
- Adjust hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs for optimal performance.

### Evaluation

- Evaluate the fine-tuned BERT model on the test set.
- Use appropriate metrics for binary classification, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Analyze the model's performance and identify areas for improvement.

### Real-World Application

- Integrate the fine-tuned BERT classifier into a customer service chatbot.
- Use the classifier to automatically route customer queries to the appropriate department (Technical Support or General Inquiry).
- Monitor the chatbot's performance and gather feedback from users to continuously improve the system.
